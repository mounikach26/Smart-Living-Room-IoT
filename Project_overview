#Project_Overview

The aim of this project is to create a smart living room where the lights can be controlled
wirelessly using a mobile phone enabled with Bluetooth technology. By implementing this
project, we will be able to remotely control the lights in your living room, providing
convenience and flexibility in managing our home lighting system.


#Tools Required

Apparatus Required:
● ESP32 development board
● Android Smartphone with Bluetooth
● 5mm LED
● 220 Ohm resistor
● Jumper wires 
● Breadboard

#Procedure

1. Hardware Connection:
- Connect the anode of an LED to GPIO23 of the ESP32.
- Connect the cathode of the LED to the GND pin of the ESP32.
2. Bluetooth Terminal Application:
- Ensure you have a Bluetooth Terminal application installed on your smartphone.
- For Android devices, you can install the "Serial Bluetooth Terminal" app from the Google
Play Store.
3. Library Installation:
- Open the Arduino IDE on your computer.
- Navigate to Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries.
- Search for "BluetoothSerial.h" and install it if it's not already installed.
4. Uploading Code to ESP32:
- Upload the provided code to the ESP32 using the Arduino IDE.
- Make sure you have selected the correct board and COM port in the Arduino IDE
settings.
5. Pairing Bluetooth Devices:
- Enable Bluetooth on your smartphone.
- Open the Bluetooth settings on your smartphone and go to the list of paired devices.
- Click on the settings icon and select "Pair new device".
- You should see the ESP32 device named "ESP32_IoTlab" in the list. Pair with it.
6. Connecting to ESP32:
- Open the "Serial Bluetooth Terminal" app on your smartphone.
- Tap the connect icon in the app.
- Select the paired ESP32 device ("ESP32_IoTlab") from the list.
- You should receive a "Connected" message indicating successful connection.
7. Controlling LED:
- In the "Serial Bluetooth Terminal" app, you can send commands
to control the LED.
- Send the letter "a" to turn the LED on. - Send the letter "b"
to turn the LED of

#Conclusion

In conclusion, by following the provided steps, we can successfully set up a
Bluetooth-controlled LED system using an ESP32 microcontroller and a smartphone. This
project allows us to remotely control the LED's state (on/off) by sending simple commands ("a"
to turn on, "b" to turn off) from the smartphone via a Bluetooth terminal application. With the
ESP32 connected to the LED and the smartphone paired with the ESP32 via Bluetooth, we can
easily toggle the LED's state wirelessly, providing convenience and flexibility in controlling
lighting systems. This project demonstrates the practical application of IoT (Internet of Things)
technology and showcases the seamless integration of hardware and software components to
create a smart and interactive environment
